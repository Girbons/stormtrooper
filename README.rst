If `Django`_ is your first choice for the conquest of the Internet, you need something that spawns quickly your
Django applications!

Getting started
---------------

The Internet is your target; start spawning your first expendable stormtrooper:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mktmpenv
    $ pip install cookiecutter
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/palazzem/stormtrooper

    # it outputs
    Cloning into 'stormtrooper'...
    remote: Counting objects: 83, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (52/52), done.
    remote: Total 83 (delta 34), reused 70 (delta 23), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (83/83), done.
    Checking connectivity... done.

Now you should give a name to your stormtrooper. Wait, it's a stormtrooper. They don't have a name.

.. code-block:: bash
    app_name [stormtrooper]: stormtrooper
